        <h1> Transport for London Cracksdown on Passengers not wearing masks </h1><br>

        <br><p> 
            
           <br> Its compulsory for passengers on public transport to wear masks. However, inspite of the 
            increasing cases some passengers still refuse to do so. <br>

           <br> In order to deal with this issue, the Transport for London have increased the number of police across
            its network. An estimate of about 500 officers. <br>

           <br> This scheme runs separately to patrols carried out on trains by BTP officers. <br>

            <br>The team waits at bus stops and wait for passengers to come off. They then locate passengers who are not wearing the<br>
            and stop them.

            <br>Fines ranging from £200 to £6,400 are meted out. <br>

            <br>So far data from TFL have recorded estimates of 9,300 people have been refused entry into the train, 2100 ejected and 1700 Fines
            have all been given out.<br> 

            <br> Andy Byford the commissioner of TFL stated that people have to step up and take responsibility for their actions. He said they know about
            the law so they cant pretend they dont. <br>

            <br> TFL however dont have enough staff to police every service <br>

            <br> Some bus drivers have claimed enforcement of wearing mask is almost non-existent <br>

            <br> They are also abused when confronting people who dont wear them <br>

            <br> TFL are trying their best to solve this issue, especially in areas where multiple reports have been made on low compliance, especially in Victoria and Brixton. 

            <br> One issue about this is that these arer labour intensive as they have to verify wheb a person has a medical exemption and it takes a while. <br>
