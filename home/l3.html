        <h1>  Nine police officers fined £200 for breaking lockdown rules in Cafe </h1><br>

        <br><p> 
            <br>Nine police officers were fined each after they met in a Cafe while on duty. These Metrolitan police's south east basic command unit was spotted by
            a passerby while easting together in Greenwich.<br>

            <br>After investigation each were fined £200 after images were posted online. 
            The police officers were in uniform with their cars parked outside. These go against the very rules they are supposed to enforce.
            According to the restrictions restaurants and cafes are only to provide takeaway service.<br> 

            <br>Brian Jennings, the person who reported the issue said to Mail Online "We noticed in the first lockdown and again today that regularly, 
            first thing in the morning, there will be half-a-dozen squad cars outside and every table full of police officers having breakfast in there.
            You read about people getting fined and it seems hypocritical as it looks like there is little social distancing in the cafe.
            I find the regular and continued flouting of social distancing and lockdown regulations by the police hypocritical and foolish 
            at this time when the infection rates in Greenwich borough are among the highest in the UK.”<br>

            <br>The South East BCU commander said,"“Police officers are tasked with enforcing the 
            legislation that has been introduced to stop the spread of the virus and the public rightly 
            expect that they will set an example through their own actions. It is disappointing that on this occasion, these officers have fallen short of that expectation. 
            It is right that they will pay a financial penalty and that they will be asked to reflect on their choices.”<br>

            <br> It is believed to be the first time on-duty emergency services workers have been given fines for breaching Covid-19 restrictions since 
            March when measures were taken to control the pandemic.<br>
            
            <br>Over the weekend, police handed out more than £40,000 worth of fines in east London alone due to rule breaches, Sky News reported."<br>
