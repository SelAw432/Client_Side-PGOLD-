        <h1> New COVID:19 Variant: What we know</h1><br/>

        <p> 
            The New Coronavirus variant appears to be more contagious than the current ones.

            Below are the opinions from Scientists.

            Over the past few days, the world has been drawn to the fact from Scientists
            that a new variant of the coronavirus has been identified.
            This various has been described to be more dangerous and genetically distict
            from the previous strains of the virus. 

            Due to this the Prime minister Boris Johnson had to introduce tighter lockdown 
            restrictions over the Christmas period. This has influenced the decision from 
            various countries to ban travel from the UK. 

            The new strain of the coronavirus has spurred debate from all over the world on
            what measures to take next. Countries have been advised to check their databases 
            as to know whether the new variant is circulating in their various areas.

            Below are what Scientist have learnt so far about the new variant:

    
        </p><br/>

        <h4>What is strange about the new variant?</h4><br/>

        <p> The new variant appeared on researchers reader during December when people began contracting 
            it from Southern England. This appeared to be spreading as early as September. 

            Taking a closer look at the virus they were shocked at the high amount of mutations it had acquired.

            The mutatations that appeared looked like it would impact the spread of the virus.
        </p><br/>

        <h4> Are symptoms more severe</h4><br/>

        <p> Theres no concrete evidence that the symptoms are more severe yet. There is a possiblity however. South Africa
            have identified a strain of the virus that is spreading quickly through the coasts. People affected with this new strain
            have been identified to have a heightened viral load. Concentration of the virus has been significantly  high in their 
            upper respiratory tract. This case is usually associated with higher sypmtoms in other viral diseases.

        </p><br/>

        <h4> Where does this variant originate from? </h4><br/>

        <p>
            This question has been the centre of debates. One possibilty has been the fact that the new mutation could have resulted after
            infecting a special set of hosts. 

            Normally when people are infected by a the coronvirus the victim becomes infectious for some days before symptoms start to show.
            The virus becomes dormant in the body before the immune system starts to kick in defence mechanisms. If a patient isn't suffering from
            a severe case of the virus they are typically negative in a few weeks at most.
            
            Sometimes in victims with weak immune systems,the coronavirus may thrive for a while. Research conducted on these victims have shown 
            that the virus can develop high numbers of mutations as it replicates in the victims system for a period of time. 
            
            
            Scientists have also discovered that natural selection favors mutant viruses that can evade the immune system. Scientists have constructed
            the hypothsis that the evolution of the new strains may be due to medicines given to such victims. Some strains of viruses can withstand drugs such as 
            monoclonal antibodies.

            Other researchers have also come to hypothesis that the virus may have developed new mutations by spreading through an animal population. 
        </p><br/>

        <br/><h4> Does the new variant mean the vaccines will be uneffective?</h4><br/>

        <p> Fortunately for us, the answer to this question is no. Experts are very doubtful that new strains will have any effect on the vaccines, though we can 
            not rule out this possibility entirely.

            The Government has authorized two new vaccines and discussion are ongoing for a third. The are the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer and BioNtech vaccine. Both
            vaccines have been assured to create some form of immunity against the viruses by training our immune system to produce antibodies that sit on the protein of the
            of the virus known as the spike.

            The spike opens up a passageway inside the cell it latches onto. Antibodies produced stick on to the spike making the viruses unable to get inside.
