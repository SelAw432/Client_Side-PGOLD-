        <h1>Prime Minister Anounces New nationwide lockdown</h1><br/>

        <p>
            The Prime minister has announced tougher national restrictions in
            England. 

            <br> The increase in death tolls and the with the new wave of cases, including
            the new strains of coronavirus the NHS is less than weeks away from being
            overwhelmed. This is has forced the Prime Minister to take drastic measures
            in order to deal with the pandemic. 

            <br>He said that no one wants to impose these kinds of measures, but no 
            responsible Prime Minister could ignore the evidence presented.

            <br>On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 cases of the virus for the seventh
            consecutive day.

            <br>The Prime Minister stated that people are to work from home unless they are a key worker
            or if they are not able to. For example construction workers.

            <br>The new variant first discovered in Kent is said to spread faster than the first variant of 
            the virus. A No 10 spokesperson made the claim that the new variant has led to rapidly escalating 
            case numbers across the country.

            <br>The new variant is said to be 50% and 70%  more transmissible.
            
            <br>Hospitals have already let known the fact that they are under extreme pressure. The current number of 
            cases is higher than that seen in spring.

            <br>On the 4th of January, covid victims in hospitals reached highs of 26,626. Which is 30% increase in just over a
            week. The hospitals admissions peak has now been surpassed by 40% while deaths recorded on 3rd January was 454.

            <br>If drastic action was not taken the capacity of hospitals may be overwhelmed. Due the lockdown restrictions in place 
            people are only allowed to get out for the reasons below. 

            

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> shopping for basic necessities</li>
            <li> to go to work if its impossible to so at home</li>
            <li> for exercise with your bubble, which is limited to once per day</li>
            <li> seek medical assistance </li>
            <li> education or childcare for those eligible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All primary schools, secondary schools and colleges are to move to online learning. Exceptions apply to children of key workers and 
            vulnerable children. 

            <br>Although children are unlikely to be affected seriously by the virus, the government feel schools must be included in the restrictions
            to have a better chance of getting the virus under control.

            <br>Early years settings such as nurseries may remain open.

            <br>All non essential stores retails will close.

            <br>Restaurants can only do takeaways and deliveries but no sit ins.
            
            <br>Essential shops can remain opened. Entertainment venues are to close but outdoor venues such as the botanical gardens may remain open for exercise as well as 
            playgrounds.

            <br>The restrictions are said to last till at least mid February. By this time the NHS hopes to at least vaccinate everyone in the top four priority groups. 
            If the NHS vaccinates the most vulnerable people in society this may ease pressure on their facilities.
