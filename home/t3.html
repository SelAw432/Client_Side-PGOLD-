        <h1> New COVID-19 vaccine approved in the UK </h1>

        <p> 
            The government has approved the use of the new Moderna vaccine in the UK.
            17 million doses have already been pre ordered and will arrive during spring. 

            <br>This is the last Covid Vaccine following the approval of the previous vaccines
            Pfizer and AstraZeneca. More are still in development. 

            <br>It has been recordered that at least 1.5 million people in the UK have already had at
            least one dose of the vaccine. 

            <br>The most vulnerable people are being vaccinated first. The aim of the Prime minister is to
            vaccinate as mush as 15 million people by February. 

            <br>Adding the Moderna vaccines to the already pre ordered vaccines, this raises the total vaccines 
            pro ordered to a combined total of 367 million doses.

            <br>The Moderna vaccine is an RNA vaccine similar to the Pfizer vaccine
             and has to be kept in storage of -20C unlike the Pfizer which has to be kept in tempearatures of around
             -70C.

             <br> Between the 3 vaccines the Astrezenaca vaccine is much easier to store as it can be kept in storage of
             regular fridge temperature. 

             <br> The Moderna vaccine has been said to deliver nearly 95% protection from severe COVID.
