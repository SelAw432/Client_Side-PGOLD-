        <h1> 2021 UK Economic Outlook </h1><br>

        <br><p> 
            
            The economy of the UK looks set to deriorate even further after the implementation of 
            tougher restrictions due to the rising rate of infections. There were high hopes for recovery after the 
            were ordered however it seems we may have to wait. 
            
            The outlook of the economy mainly depends on how well the country deals with the pandemic.
            In order to gauge the uncertain nature of the virus and what may happen in the future KPMG proposed 3 scenarios.
            These scenarios have helped to predict what may or may not be the economy of the UK.

            <img src="images/index/3scenarios.png">

            In the main scenario, we expect that infection rate may drop which would lead to the gradual easing of restrictions.
            If there isnt any new variant then we can expect to heading back to "normal" by the end of Autumn.  

            In the downside, we assume that the new strains may be resistant to the vaccine or there may even be a newer strain 
            of the virus which may be more contagious and resistant to the vaccines. This would trigger the devlopment of a new vaccine 
            and would prompt the governmentto tighten restrictions till at least the development of a new vaccine. The new vaccine may take at least
            four months to develop. The gorvenment as well would need to be confident of the new vaccine and about the infection rate of the new variants, 
            hospital admissions and other factors such as the immunization of the most vulnerable people. All these and more need to be considered.

            The upside scenario, the scenario we all hope for is that the vaccine works as hoped and possibly even better. This would reduce the number of patients
            needing critical care. If this is the case the Government would more than likely be confident of lifting some restrictions. This may also be more rapid then expected
            and would definitely have a positive effect on the economy. 

            We however dont know how efective the vaccine may actually be. There also a cause for worry for the gap between doses, as every patient is to take two doses and 
            the Government is currently rolling out single doses per person so the scale of people who have received it is larger.

            If we also lift restrictions and children gow back to school, it has been proving that the rate of infections also increase drastically. The Government would have to find a
            balance between infection rate and letting children go back to school.

        </p>
            <h2>GDP</h2>
        <p>
            The increase in COVID cases is expected to affect the economy before enough people are vaccinated which may well prompt 
            the relaxation of some of the rules. The end of December there were high hopes for the economy but the discovery of variant
            strains of coronavirus clouded hopes. The new variant being more contagious meant that infection rates increased which caused the
            government to tighten restrictions. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility GDP was expected to grow by 5.5% in November now its quite uncertain what the future may hold for us.
            It has been predicted that the country may not return to its pre-COVID peak till at least 2022.
            The new restrictions mean that the GDP may suffer a further drop of 6% by Easter. There is however some light at the end of the tunnel. The successfull oredering of 
            vaccines may be a cause for joy considering now there are 3 vaccines all on their way to the UK. 
            The prospect of all vunerable people being vaccinated by the end of April may mean that the GDP could grow by 
            4.2% by the end of 2021. 

            Using the 3 scenarios from KPMG, we can predict what the future may or may not hold. 

            <b>Main Scenario</b>: Consumer spendings are predicted to be robust as households can use lockdown 
            savings to do some activities they were initally impossible. GPD is predicted to pick up again as
            the situation heads back to normal most probably during the autumn. Continuous recovery may see the economy head back to its pre-Covid 
            level by 2023. We cannot neglect the impact of Brexit however.

            <b>Upside Scenario:</b>Assuming all restrictions all lifted due to the rapid decrease of infections due to the effective distribution of 
            the vaccine, we can expect to see a stronger rebound of the GDP in the third qurater of 2021.

            <b>Downside Scenario:</b> In the downside scenario growth can only pick up around next year. This is due to maybe new strains of the virus 
            which may be resistant and more contagious leading to tigher restrictions.

        <h2> Unemployment</h2>
        <p>
            According to the Guardian, the rate of unemployment is expected to increase rapidly in 2021 once the furlogh scheme is closed. KGMP also predict likewise
            across all the 3 scenarios as the ongoing lockdown will have a destructive effect on the labour market. 

            <b>Main Scenario:</b> The unemployment rate may reach a peak of 6.3%, after would start to decline when lockdown restrictions begin to lift gradually. Recovery 
               is expected to pick up from September going as the last restrictions are lifted.

            <b>Upside Scenario:</b> The absence of restriction from May going may mean a more rapid recovery aiding the employment rate. 

            <b>Downside Scenario</b> Restrictions in this situation would continue to tighten leading to a more rapid increase in unemployment.  This scenario avoids the cliff-edge of ending
            the furlough scheme in May; the severe and deteriorating pandemic conditions would make the extension of the furlough scheme inevitable. However, despite the extension of the job 
            support schemes, these are unlikely to completely prevent job losses throughout the year
            
            However, despite the extension of the job support schemes, these are unlikely to completely prevent job losses throughout the year. In this scenario, we forecast that the unemployment 
            rate will continue to rise, peaking at 6.9% in February 2022.

            In the event that job support schemes are not extended past April this year, the downside scenario could see the unemployment rate reaching 9% by the time of a final lockdown in November 2021.
        </p>

        <h2> Inflation </h2>
        <p>
            Inflation dropped to the lowest levels on record in 2020. This was due to global oil prices and companies also reducing the 
            price of thei products to cope with the decrease in demand. The consumer price index fell to 0.3% in the UK. 

            The Inflation rate is also expected to continue to be low for the year 2021 as the economy recovers. The rate of inflation is expected to stay 
            below 2% all scenarios. 

            The main scenario may see that inflation rates stay at an estimate of around 1.7% from July and into 2022.
            
            If restrictions continue to ease more rapidly then we could witness a burst in inflation rate due to a faster recovery. The On the otherhand
            if restrictions continue to tighten would cause inflation rates to drop before returning to an upward trajectory.
