Marks returned 22 February 2021
Format
 DUO – Turnitin: documentation (converted into PDF
file).
 DUO: compressed (.zip or .rar) file comprising - code,
resource files, readme .txt.

###----------REQUIREMENTS------------###
Develop a JavaScript programme that will:
 include control statements, objects and include get/set operations
 include JavaScript classes, with: constructors
 showcase the principles of abstraction, modelling, prototypal inheritance
 apply imperative programming principles
 apply DOM

Consider user interfacing
 present your programme as a web application, by writing a set of HTML pages and
CSS files
 adapt your web application for mobile devices

Apply good programming practices by:
 using tools that support software development, i.e. web frameworks, Git, etc.
 demonstrating code reuse
 writing documentation - communicate technical information about your system by
using JSDoc
 accounting for code quality (you can use ESLint rule below, standard or
recommended).

###------------TASKS-----------------###

Develop a web application that will provide the latest information on Covid-19 in a specific
area in the UK (or your country of origin). Note that you will not be evaluated on your data
analytics skills; the focus here is on ASSESSING your CLIENT SIDE SCRIPTING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS.

Note: ALternatively you can look for Covid-19 information with a greater focus on  e.g. biological or medical aspects.

The application has to include the following functionality:
 input interface, with an option for the user to input information (input text, select from
options, etc.), e.g. on location, age, health condition, etc.
 and output interface, that will use a variety of methods to present output information
to the user, including most of the following:
- textual content
- images, videos
- image maps
- maps
- interactive visualizations – graphs, charts, diagrams.

###----------MANDATORY CONTENT-------------#####

number of infected and death cases (trends over a certain period of time) -> based on
that to label the area as low, medium or high risk;
 government advice, restriction measures for individuals to follow (work, socializing,
etc.);
 maps with the most affected locations/clusters;
 availability of hospitals.

Additionally, select any two of the following to also include:
shops, restaurants, cafes, pubs opening times and other measures they abide by;
 effect on public transport services;
 effect on economy/business -> trends over a certain period of time;
 effect on population’s mental health -> trends over a certain period of time.

###-----------Marking Criteria-----------####

System functionality : 30 marks
- The system did what it was expected to do (including: accepting input, processing
data, presenting information in various formats)
- Demonstrated use of: control statements, classes, abstraction, modeling,
imperative programming, DOM



Code quality: 25 marks
- Code quality was accounted for (including: reliability, testability, resolving
defects/bugs, consistency, portability, code length)
- Appropriate parameterization was used, including defaults
- HTML page was valid
- There is evidence of use of software development tools, e.g. Bootstrap framework




Documentation: 25 marks
Usability and clarity
(continued on next page)

- All methods and parameters were documented
- Enough detail was provided to use the code without having to read it
- Code would be clear to understand for maintainers
- Referencing and acknowledgment of the source of original code and/or data
(including licenses)




Interface: 20 marks
Presentation, design and usability of user interface:
- Interface style and design was attractive and appropriate for the domain of
  application (colours, fonts, page element position, etc.)
- Appropriate on-page controls/interactivity were applied
- Interface was usable: easy to use, easy to learn, intuitive, interactive,      responsive
